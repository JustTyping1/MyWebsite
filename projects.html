  <p class = "Stock-description">A machine learning model that uses linear regression to try to predict how stocks will move. It can currently predict 3 indecies (Dow Jones, S&P 500 as well as the XETRA DAX index.) It uses the python libraries of scikitlearn (for the actual ML), pandas (for the data management) abd tkinter (for the user interface). To learn more about linear regression, click </p>

  <p class = "Toolkit-description">An application that provides useful buttons for programmers, all in on place. It is made with a simple and clean UI. It includes a built-in timer, a to-do list, a calculator, as well as links to YouTube, GitHub, Stack Overflow and a binary/ascii chart. It is designed to make it so that a programmer can have it open in the background whislt coding and use it seamlessly!</p>

  <p class = "Physics-description">A program where physical constants can be modified and then a simulation pops up. You can drag and drop a box and move it around. The purpose is to be an educational tool so that certain physics constants can be demonstrated. This program isn't necessarily very polished, but it helped me to learn pygame and smooth movement.</p>
