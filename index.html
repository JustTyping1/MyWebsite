    Hello! I am JustTyping1! I like maths, physics and computer science!
    I am currently working on this website! I know how to use quite a few tools, but I prefer working in Python, C, Golang or Java. I also am very confident with Linux and its command promt. I can also use a Raspberry Pi and enjoy working on automation projects. I am also learning machine learning with scikit-learn at the moment!
