    Hello! I am JustTyping1! I like maths, physics and computer science!
    I am currently working on this website! I know how to use quite a few tools, but I prefer working in Python, Golang or Java. I also am very confident with Linux and its terminal. I can also use a Raspberry Pi and enjoy working on automation projects. I am also learning machine learning with scikit-learn at the moment!

    1p, 2p, 5p, 10p, 20p, 50p, £1 (100p), and £2 (200p).
  </p>
  <br>
  <p>
    How many different ways can £2 be made using any number of coins?
